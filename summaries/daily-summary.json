  "summary": "**London Today: Budget Hopes, Justice Served, and Winter Challenges**\n\nAs the UK prepares for next week's Budget announcement, business leaders in London's financial district have voiced their priorities, urging measures that support economic growth and innovation. Anticipation builds as the Government is expected to approve significant infrastructure projects, including an extension of the Docklands Light Railway, to bolster the city's connectivity.\n\nIn a significant development within the city's justice system, former Metropolitan Police officer David Carrick, already serving a life sentence, faces further punishment following new convictions for additional sex crimes. This case underscores ongoing issues of misconduct within London's police force.\n\nWinter's harsh onset has highlighted the plight of rough sleepers in London. Camden Council and other areas activated emergency protocols to provide shelter to the homeless as temperatures plummet, emphasizing the critical need for robust social support systems during extreme weather.\n\nAmidst these pressing issues, cultural and community developments continue. Wimbledon faces a legal challenge over its ambitious plans to expand its facilities, while proposals to convert a former police station in Teddington into a healthcare hub look to repurpose valuable city real estate for community benefit.\n\nLastly, the city hosts a unique cultural event as iconic film costumes, worn by stars such as Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet, are displayed before being auctioned. This blend of nostalgia and the arts provides a lighter note to the day's news.",
